Research Assistant

This project is an AI-powered research assistant built using LangChain and OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model. It automates the process of researching a topic by using built-in tools like web search, Wikipedia lookup, and data saving. The assistant takes a user query, gathers relevant information using external tools, and returns a structured summary that includes the topic, a concise summary, sources used, and which tools were involved.

Perfect for quickly compiling research briefs or summaries in a consistent format, with all output validated using Pydantic models.(check the tool,file_agent files)

[Also implemented a similar project as part of trying out AGNO(phidata)](Chekc the agent.py file)
